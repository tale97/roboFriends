# [Robo Friends](https://tale97.github.io/roboFriends/)

## Description

This is a simple page where there are a bunch of cards with robots. There is a search box to search for each robot.  
This project really doesn't add value to any one's life. It was simply a project that I build from taking Andrei Neagoie's 
[The Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WcUAkYddltSQXo=/). The reason I built
this was to get a hang of the basic of using React framework.
